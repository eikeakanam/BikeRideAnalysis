## Objective
The project focuses on the comparative analysis of bike rides in London during the Autumn and Spring seasons and bike rides between London and New York specifically during the Spring season. 
By examining these datasets, I gained insights into the cycling patterns and trends within London and then identified any similarities and differences between the two cities during the Spring season including bike ride behavior, popular routes, and factors influencing bike usage between London and New York. 
This analysis provided valuable information on bike ride behavior and helped identify any variations in biking culture between London and New York.
