## Project objective: COmparative Analysis of bike ride patterns in London and New York.
The project focuses on the comparative analysis of bike rides in London during the Autumn and Spring seasons and bike rides between London and New York specifically during the Spring season. 

By examining these datasets, I gained insights into the cycling patterns and trends within London and then identified any similarities and differences between the two cities during the Spring season including bike ride behavior, popular routes, and factors influencing bike usage between London and New York. 

This analysis provided valuable information on bike ride behavior and helped identify any variations in biking culture between London and New York.

## Data Source
London: Transport For London (TFL)
New York: CitiRide, New York USA

## Key metrics:
Ride duration: Analyzing the average duration of bike rides in London and New York during Spring and within London during Autumn and Spring
Popular routes: Identifying the most frequently used bike routes in each city.
User demographics: Analyzing the demographics of bike riders, such as age and gender, to understand the user base.
Ride frequency: Determining the average number of bike rides hourly, daily, and monthly in London and New York.

# Analytics and Observations
# Autumn v Spring Season in London
In terms of number of rides, there was a steady increase in the total number of rides for successive months during Spring (March - May) which could be attributed to the fact that the weather became warmer / more friendly and had longer days meaning more people could cycle until late evenings.

On the other hand, there was a significant decline in the total number of rides for successive months during Autumn (September - November 2014). This could also largely be attributed to the fact that the weather gradually became colder in the months leading up to winter and experienced longer nights which results in less bike rides, especially early evenings.

In terms of days of the week, people rode for longer periods over the weekend on Sunday and Saturday respectively during both seasons but experienced more bike rides, mostly during the week (Wednesday) for spring and Friday for Autumn.

# London v New York (Spring Season)
An analysis of the distribution revealed that during the Spring of 2014, the duration of bike rides was shorter in New York compared to London, across all days of the week. Despite people riding for longer periods over the weekend, it was observed that there were more bike rides during the weekdays compared to the weekends in both cities. Specifically, in London, the highest number of rides was recorded on Wednesday, while in New York, Tuesday had the highest number of rides. This indicates that weekdays were generally busier in terms of bike ride activities.

March had the lowest number of rides in both cities, with London having a significant lead over New York. April and May saw an increase in rides in both cities, with London consistently maintaining a higher number of rides. Overall, London had a consistently higher number of monthly rides compared to New York during the analyzed period. This suggests that biking was more popular or widely used as a mode of transportation in London during the spring months of 2014. Some factors that  could possibly influence this includes: Public transport limitations in London resulting which makes more people opt for bike rides, more awareness and promotions on cycling in London, better cycling infrastructure including dedicated cycling lanes etc.
